			<h1>There is No Door Here</h1>
			<p>It seems that there are some people in the world who do not realize that there is no beautiful door in front of them.  It seems that in their stupidity, they need to be told that there is no door and they should not walk into a wall.  I believe that every person needs to be taught about the gloriest doors that have graced us with their presence so that we do not walk into walls trying to escape the domains of rooms.</p>

			<h1>A Freezer is not a Exit</h1>
			<p>Ah, another case for human stupidity. It seems that humans are not aware of their surrounding doors anymore.  People seem to now believe that a door into the realm of milk is an exit from the drudgeries of grocery shopping.  I will not stand for this injustice to doors. The human race must be made aware of their fellows in doors.  The humans are so foolish in their door distinctions, that they need to put labels on them.  Do you humans need labels on a professional athlete and a lawyer in order to tell them apart?  No? Then don't put labels on these beautiful doors.</p>

			</div>
			<h1>In & Out Automatic Doors</h1>
			<p>Automatic doors are a miracle in modern door engineering, they open and close without grimey human hands touching them.  BUT! It appears that some human got the smart idea of labeling a single set of doors as both the entrance and exit.  This human does not realize that these automatic doors are both the barrier to the same portal.  I am here to tell you that this door has feelings and it feels abused by the confusion caused by these dumb signs.</p>

			</div>
			<h1>The Punishing Exit</h1>
			<p>This door is unused in this world.  It is designed to be an exit, but if you try to use it as an exit, then you are asked to use a different exit.  It is time to stand up for the working doors.  Exit door lives matter.  This exit needs loving and we should love it for what it is, not what the world thinks it should be.</p>

			<div class="pic">
				<img src="images/signs/0006.jpg" class="images" alt="I'm the other door">
			</div>
			<h1>I'm the Other Door</h1>
			<p>First off, I am flabbergasted that the human race is so stupid that they have to be told that a certain door is the other door.  I mean, really, there is an arrow on the sign that says to use the other door that points directly at the door.  Do people assume that sign means that the other door is in Kenya or Uruguay. Second, this sign disgraces left doors, people always go through the right door, so the keymaster of this door just went with the stereotype and put up a sign to tell people to not use a beautiful door such as this one.</p>

			<div class="pic">
				<img src="images/signs/0007.jpg" class="images" alt="Unlock door before going through">
			</div>
			<h1>Unlock Door Before Entering</h1>
			<p>Wow, just wow.  Are people just trying to go through this door before unlocking?  Is there a hoard of idiotic humans just banging their faces against the door because they are too dumb to unlock it?  This is a social injustice to all doors everywhere, people need to be taught that doors need to be unlocked before moving their masses through the frame of the door.</p>

				<img src="images/signs/0008.jpg" class="images" alt="Do not enter the entrance">
			</div>
			<h1>Do Not Enter the Entrance</h1>
			<p>This sign is a grave disgrace to this door.  This door has been labled as an entrance to a world of wonders (probably), yet the lime suckling humans have decided that they are too good for it and have told all other manner of creatures to not use the door for its designated role in society.  This just like the exit that forces people to use other exits. I am saddened by the state of human-door relations in modern culture.</p>

			<div class="pic">
				<img src="images/signs/0009.jpg" class="images" alt="Pull, then Push, then Go Away">
			</div>
			<h1>Pull, then Push, then Go Away</h1>
			<p>This sign is a symbol of the sniveling human laziness.  Push and Pull signs are designed for humans to respect the ways of the door.  Yet, this human has decided to make a sign that tells people to try both because they are too lazy to figure out the rotation of a simple door.  Respect the Door!!!</p>
