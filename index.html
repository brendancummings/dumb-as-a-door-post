				<h1>Dumb as a Doorpost</h1>
				<p>Doors are a magnificent thing.  They prevent people from coming in and the prevent people from getting out.  With a door on your side, the same door would also be on the other side of the wall.  A door offers access to that place over there.  When you walk through a door, you are doing the exact same thing that billions of people do every day.  Doors are not very special, unless you find them here.  Here, doors are welcome to be themselves, do what they please, and look really, really stupid.  Here, doors can be as dumb as a doorpost.</p>

				<h1>About Us</h1>
				<p>At Dumb as a Doorpost, we are devoted to enlightening the world to the abuses and malformities of underrepresented doors. Doors should be considered sacred in today's society, for they are passages to the next room. Without doors, people would be stuck in boxes and only be able to escape by the measly windows that are so stupid. We believe that the world is a better place with doors.  Here, we build a community of forsaken and broken doors that look really ugly and have no place in this world, and share their horrendous beauty with people who never asked to see something so disgusting that they would want to tear the eyes right out of their head and shove it into the nearest garbage can.  Doors now have a place to reveal their true personalities and get mocked and ridiculed for it.</p>
